# Petstravaganza

Flatiron Module 4 project by Peyton Doyle and Pete Hanner

Paired project focusing on JavaScript basics. In this game, users are tasked with taking care of several adorable animals at their pet daycare. Each of the six animals has four care options (eat, drink, exercise, and potty), which are populated in a task list for the player to keep up. Players earn points by successfully caring for their animals, but can lose points by letting tasks go undone for too long or by clicking the wrong task.
